## 10/4/2025 - planning + schematic  

I already had the materials in mind previously, but now I was able to complete the schematic (which isn't perfect, but it makes sense to me). After this I want to make BOM so I have a list of all the components I need. I'm not really familiar with CAD, but I might try it out for this.
From start to this, I've spent (approximately) 3.5 hours. These involved making a list of goals that I wanted my design to achieve + constraints. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to power the MP3 player. At first, I wanted to use the TP4056 battery charging module + a boost converter, but I found it would be much better to instead use the Adafruit Powerboost 1000C to charge both the battery and power the circuit.
I also considered using various different music players, but ultimately settled on the DFPlayer Mini.
This research part took a LOT of time as I swapped different components for others, looked at prices and capabilities, figured out how I was going to wire them, and made the schematic. But now that the heavy lifting is done, it shouldn't be too difficult from now on! :>!
